    "narrative_BACKGROUND": "STUDENT, EMPLOYEE AND /OR COMMUNITY BENEFIT:\u00a0For International Baccalaureate (IB) students, pursuing the Diploma Programme (DP) is extremely rigorous. It is made more challenging as students try to take all state-required graduation courses and DP course requirements.\u00a0 Students typically must take Gov/Free Enterprise online. Many of the DP students already must take Alg II online to accelerate in math. All IB DP students have 7 classes per year, Theory of Knowledge (TOK), the Extended Essay Research Project, and the CAS Portfolio. They also take 13-16 on-demand writing exams in 3 weeks at the end of senior year. The Academics Department requests a course revision to the current IB History 2 course for the 25-26 school year. Approval of this request is a necessary first step in our effort to submit the revised IB History 2 course, which contains standards from AP Government/Free Enterprise (SOC 8060) and AM/AZ Government/Free Enterprise (SOC 8050) approval from the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR). A revised syllabus and course outline are provided to support the change.",

This course is designed for students with an Intellectual Disability (ID) Category of Eligibility to earn a Foreign Language credit.\u00a0The goal is to expand opportunities for students with an Intellectual Disability through alternative scheduling, ensuring they have access to a curriculum that supports their unique learning needs.

This unexpected cancellation has left us without a location for this significant event, requiring immediate action to secure an alternative venue. Given the short notice of this cancellation, the standard procurement process cannot be followed without risking the inability to secure an appropriate venue in time. Graduation is a critical event for students, families, and staff, and any delay in securing a new location could result in unavailability, logistical challenges, and significant disruptions to planning. Additionally, the requirement to place a deposit quickly to hold the new venue necessitates and expedited decision making process.

For parents/students who consent to have information released, GCU proactively offers student admittance. This model puts the student and family in the position of deciding to accept or decline GCU\u2019s offer rather than GCU accepting the student. GCU will include scholarship eligibility, which may help students consider attending a postsecondary institution who otherwise may have thought it not financially feasible.",

    "narrative_BACKGROUND": "On February 13, 2025, the District issued RFP #25-02-30 for Audit Services through OpenGov and legal advertisement was published in the Arizona Business Gazette on February 13, 2025. There were two thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight (2928) notified users (vendors) and two (2) responses received. The evaluation committee consisted of Quay Bolton-Lattari (Executive Director of Support Services), Rosa Ramirez (Finance Manager), and Mike Shepard (Executive Director of Finance). The evaluation committee evaluated the proposals based on the criteria outline in the RFP. STUDENT, EMPLOYEE AND /OR COMMUNITY BENEFIT: The award of a contract under this RFP will result in multi-term contract for one-year with the option of four (4) annual renewals beginning fiscal year 2025/2026. The estimated requirements cover the period of the contracts and are reasonable and continuing. The use of the subsequent multi-term contracts will serve the best interests of the school district by encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting economies of scale in school district procurement. If monies are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract can be canceled.",

These overviews reflect the school\u2019s specialized focus in the fine arts and highlight the distinctive educational opportunities it offers. The development of this specialized course catalog represents a key milestone as The Hilltop administration prepares to host informational sessions for prospective students and their families.",
    "narrative_BACKGROUND": "In alignment with Governing Board Policies IGA (Curriculum Development), IGD (Curriculum Adoption), and IHA (Basic Instructional Program), all new courses are subject to approval by the Governing Board. The proposed courses support the district's strategic commitment to diverse learning pathways, curriculum innovation, and responsiveness to evolving student needs and aspirations. Due to the number of new courses associated with The Hilltop School for the Arts, a new individual course proposal form is not being submitted for each course. The Hilltop staff will continue to work on curriculum development this summer and can provide updates at a future board meeting. STUDENT, EMPLOYEE, AND /OR COMMUNITY BENEFIT: These new courses will expand access to high-quality instruction and learning experiences in fine and performing arts and support students to develop specialized industry skills, critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration skills. They will also provide foundational training for students pursuing postsecondary studies or careers in the arts.
